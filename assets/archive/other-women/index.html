      <h3>Premise</h3>

      <p>
        Back in 2012, fresh out of college, I worked with a web designer and
        consultant. One of the projects I got to work on was a side project of
        his called <strong>Kernest "Konstellations"</strong> -- a collection of
        CSS themes inspired by works of text. I did one based on the short
        story, "Yellow Wallpaper," (there was much yellow, a notoriously
        difficult color to work with I found). My predecessor did a more
        illustrative example, a dialogue taken from "Romeo and Juliet" where she
        used purples and reds to create a romantic mood. It was a fun project,
        and revisiting themes is something I occasionally get to do in my
        current work, but not often enough.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recently, in the spring of 2020, it occurred to me that I was
        languishing creatively in my day job as an in-house web developer.
        Worse, I hadn't been making a concerted effort to develop my core
        front-end development tools, HTML and CSS. Luckily I found myself
        following <strong>Jen Simmons</strong>, a Designer and Developer
        Advocate at Mozilla, who produced fantastic videos exploring CSS grid
        and Flexbox. She produced a series of experiments (that you can find on
        her <a href="//labs.jensimmons.com/">website here</a>) that inspired me
        to look for examples in graphic design from other disciplines, and to
        try building them out in a web browser.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here, I present my first entry into making
        <strong>NICE THINGS</strong> to improve my craft, for the funsies, and
        for anyone who might find it interesting or neat.

      <h3>About this theme</h3>

      <p>
        I discovered this book cover in a graphic design book my sister gave me
        many birthdays ago, called
        <em
          >Stylepedia: A Guide to Graphic Design Mannerisms, Quirks, and
          Conceits</em
        >
        by <strong>Steven Heller</strong> and <strong>Louise Fili</strong>. In
        their section titled "Big Book," the authors discuss the work of
        designer <strong>Paul Bacon</strong>, who in 1956 began the "Big Book
        Look" trend in book jacket design. This style should be familiar to avid
        readers: a prominent title and author's name set in large text. Bacon
        created the book jacket for <em>Other Women</em> by
        <strong>Lisa Alther</strong> for its debut in 1984.
      </p>

        />

        The webfonts I found are not an exact replica of the type in this
        design, but they convey a similar mood and character. I never learned
        the typeface used for the author's name and title (if it is not instead
        a hand-lettered type), and the closest match on Google fonts that I
        liked the best was
        <a href="//fonts.google.com/specimen/Berkshire+Swash">Berkshire Swash</a
        >. I had better luck with the small text, which I believe is
        <a href="//www.linotype.com/90458/windsor-family.html">Windsor</a>
        thanks to the tool <a href="//www.identifont.com/">Identifont</a>. Alas,
        I am cheap and did not purchase a copy of it to use for this project, so
        I found an alternative,
        <a
          href="//fonts.google.com/specimen/Tinos"
          aria-label="Learn more about the webfont Tinos"
          >Tinos</a
        >.

        <br /><br />

        This was a fun first assignment. The colors are not something I would
        normally choose, and the overlapping text and elements was an
        interesting graphic design challenge to recreate with CSS grid. I'm
        excited for the next piece I find!
